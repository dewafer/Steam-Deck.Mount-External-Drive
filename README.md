# Legacy Branch! Use Main!
# Steam-Deck.Mount-External-Drive
Scripts to Auto-Mount (and to Manually mount & unmount from `GameMode`) External USB SSD on the Steam Deck

# How does this work?

a `udev` rule is added to `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-external-drive-mount.rules`
which calls systemd `/etc/systemd/system/external-drive-mount@[sda1|sda2|sdd1|etc].service`
that then runs `automount.sh` to Auto Mount any plugged in USB Storage Device.

`/etc/fstab` is not required for mounting in this way, (however if a Device has an `fstab` entry these scripts will still work)

# Operation

The External Drive(s) will be Auto-Mounted to `/run/media/deck/[LABEL]` eg `/run/media/deck/External-ssd/` if the Device has no `label` then the Devices `UUID` will be used eg `/run/media/deck/a12332-12bf-a33ab-eef/`

The install will also offer an optional install of `zMount.sh` which will be added to your Steam Library as a non-steam game which can be ran from `GameMode`, this will allow manual (un)mounting of USB Devices and the SD-Card. (NOTE: This is probably more useful for unmounting as the auto mount script should mount anything anyway).

### NOTE!

Drive requires prior formatting (currently tested with NTFS, Ext4, btrfs, NOTE: btrfs mounts with incorrect ownership, TODO). All Partitions will be Mounted on Boot and /or On Insert.

~~Drive will still need added to Steam as a Steam Library Folder in Desktop mode initially but will appear on subsequent Boots/Inserts.~~ This was the case until recently, now however the Steam Library on the Drive was no longer added to Steam on Inserting the Drive. As Such I've "stolen" the following `systemd-run -M 1000@ --user --collect --wait sh -c "./.steam/root/ubuntu12_32/steam steam://addlibraryfolder/${url@Q}"` from Valve SD Card Auto Mounting Service (which is pretty similar it turns out!). This "should" automatically add any pre existing `SteamLibrary` folders if at the root of the drive.

# Installation

# Uninstall

`sudo rm /etc/udev/rules.d/99-external-drive-mount.rules`

`sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/external-drive-mount@.service`

`sudo rm -r /home/deck/.local/share/scawp/SDMED`

`sudo udevadm control --reload`

`sudo systemctl daemon-reload`

# WORK IN PROGRESS!

This will probably have bugs, so beware! log bugs under [issues](https://github.com/scawp/Steam-Deck.Mount-External-Drive/issues)!
